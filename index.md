### Bio

I am a Master's student of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna (starting in 2025), working on various Machine Learning projects. Before that, I was a Computer Science undergraduate student at Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran. (2020-2025)

Today, I am especially interested in computer vision and real-time machine learning problems. I also follow innovations in neuro-AI.

I like to work on both theoretical and practical aspects of AI, and I shift my focus from time to time to handle projects properly.
